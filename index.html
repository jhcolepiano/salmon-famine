            <h2>At Silverwood City Hall...</h2>
            <h4>The Mystery</h3>
            <p>
                The year is 2017. Because of your famed ecosystem expertise, you've been flown out to 
                Silverwood, Washington to investigate a local mystery. At City Hall, Mayor Edwin Blackston 
                explains the case.
            </p>
            <p>    
                "Each fall, the rivers of Silverwood are usually full of salmon swimming upriver to lay 
                their eggs, or <i>spawn</i> as it's called. Every year... except this year. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                "This year, 
                the salmon populations were so much smaller 
                than usual that tens of thousands of dollars in the fishing and tourism industry were lost. 
                Rumors are spreading that the beautiful rivers of Silverwood have been poisonedâ€”if 
                Silverwood loses its reputation as a prime fishing and vacation destination, it would 
                be our ruin!
            </p>
            <p>
                "Please help solve the case of the salmon famine before itâ€™s too late!""
            </p>
            <h4>Your Mission</h4>
            <p>
                Salmon populations in Silverwood rivers are far smaller this year than before. 
                Why? Solve the riddles to earn trips around Silverwood to interview suspects and 
                gather clues. Find the culprit and recommend what Silverwood 
                officials should do to save their salmon!
            </p>

            <h4>About Silverwood</h4>
            <p>
                Mayor Blackston shares a little more information about Silverwood while walking out out 
                of City Hall. Primarily known for beautiful streams and excellent salmon fishing, Silverwoods' biggest 
                local industry is tourism. As a result, when the national economy struggles, fewer people 
                can afford an expensive fishing getaway, and the local economy takes a big hit. In 2013, 
                Mayor Blackson sought to stabilize the economy by attracting new employers to the region, 
                chiefly by offering tax breaks and other incentives.

                    Dr. Flo Banks greets you. She takes you on a tour of her lab and 
                    shares some of the research she and Dr. Reimchen have been working on
                    that relates to salmon and nitrogen, a substance found in living things
                    and rich soil. The writing is pretty technical, but you underline some
                    key passages in their paper--you have a feeling it could be very useful
                    in understanding connections between the salmon and 
                    other parts of its ecosystem.

            <p>
                You asked the Department of Fish and Wildlife Services to mark the environment of the 
                local salmon on your map. They explained that the sockeye salmon in this area are a 
                migratory species that live part of their lives in the ocean, and part in freshwater 
                streams. Each year, many adult salmon come to this area to spawn (lay their eggs) and 
                eventually die here. Within 1 year after they hatch, the new generation of fish swims 
                downstream to the ocean, and comes back to spawn 3 years later.

            <h2>At the Environmental Protection Agency...</h2>
            <p>
                The local department has data on the health of Silverwood Creek's water 
                over recent decades. You ask Sara Smallfoot, the agent who brought you 
                the report, to help you interpret the data. She explains: 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Cooler, faster moving water holds more dissolved gases. When water 
                sits in the sunshine for longer, the temperature goes up, and gases can 
                escape. Animals need oxygen to breathe, so high amounts of dissolved 
                oxygen is a good sign for creek health. However, high dissolved nitrogen 
                typically comes from pollution, and is usually a bad sign for streams 
                like Silverwood Creek."

            <h2>At the Home of Lorraine Hadwick...</h2>
            <p>
                Lorraine Hadwick is the widow of the late Martin Hadwick. 
                She's a passionate fundraiser and a very fast talker. After the death 
                of her husband, she started an organization called Bear Scare. 
                She gives you a flyer explaining their mission, and demonstrates 
                some of the equipment that they use to keep bears away from Silverwood 
                Creek, including a device that makes very loud sounds too high-pitched 
                for humans to hear. "A few guys were upset in 2006 when we first got  
                the equipment up--they tried to bring their dogs fishing, and the dogs 
                whined and wouldn't leave  the truck! But I told them that just proves 
                that what we're doing will work. And they sure changed their tune when 
                they saw how much more salmon they were able to get! I know Martin would 
                be so proud of what we've accomplished."

            <h2>At the Home of Dan Lewis...</h2>
            <p>
                Dan Lewis, owner of ABC Logging Company for 25 years, isn't much of a talker. 
                He seems much more comfortable among the trees and his tools than in the company 
                of a detective. As a hobbyist fisherman living on the banks of Silverwood Creek, 
                he has observed the declining salmon runs firsthand, but he says that he's also 
                concerned about the health of the trees around the creek. "They just not thriving 
                like they was," he says, gruffly when you ask for more details.
            </p>       
                "Hey, uh, I don't know what more to tell ya, but my mother-in-law sent me this 
                clipping from a magazine she was reading--I think it's about salmon. Maybe it will 
                be useful to you?" He's clearly trying to get rid of you, but you take the 
                magazine article and politely skim through it. Surprisingly, it looks like it 
                might be useful after all! Dan also suggests that you talk to a community organizer 
                and bed and breakfast owner named Bea Tartan. "She always knows what's going on and 
                she's real invested in having a healthy stream for the tourists, you know. 
                Plus, she likes talkin' to folks from out of town.

            <h2>At the Cottage of Bea Tartan...</h2>
            <p>
                When you walk up the lane to Bea Tartan's lovely cottage that she rents 
                as a Bed and Breakfast, you can't help noticing how tidy everything looks. 
                Not a flower petal, blade of grass or speck of mulch is out of place.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Bea greets you at the door of her cottage with a cup of tea and a giant blueberry 
                muffin. She introduces herself as the current Vice President (and former 
                president) of the Silverwood Beautification Committee. "Silverwood has the 
                potential to be THE vacation destination of the Pacific Northwest, but to 
                earn that spot, we really need to be picture-perfect in every way. I led 
                the committee in a massive clean-up effort of Silverwood Creek three years 
                ago... I guess that was 2014. We got volunteers from all over the community 
                to help clear unsightly logs and fallen branches and smooth the gravel to 
                provide accessible beauty for everyone. We removed some dying trees, and 
                of course we got rid of any litter that we found too. There was suddenly 
                so much more space along the riverbanks for picnics and family reunions and 
                photos. So many more people visited Silverwood after that, from all over the 
                country! Gina Starr is doing advocacy work at State right now, but she wanted 
                me to give you this." 
            </p>
            <p>    
                She gives you a flyer from the time advertising the event, along with a 
                note from the current committee president. "Gina wanted me to give you this. 
                She doesn't think we need another clean up, and it's true that the stream is 
                still looking fairly neat, but of course, every year, we get more leaves and 
                twigs and muck cluttering the stream bed. In my opinion, the salmon are telling 
                us its time for another clean up!"
